Radiologist Jr. (RJ) is the visual question answering system I developed while working as an AI fellow at Insight data science.Â It takes a Radiology image as an input and natural language question about the image and generates natural language answer as an output.



As more and more medical information is digitised there is need for intelligent medical technology. In radiology, with its wealth of image data and reports, RJ could assist radiologists in faster reporting and also benefit trainees who have questions about the size of a mass or presence of a fracture. This will help hospital reduce waiting time on diagnosis and better patient care. It can also aid leanring in Medical Simulation Centers.
